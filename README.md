# Simple-Random-number-Guesser
A user is given 5 chances to guess a number between 1-10, if they guess a number lower than the actual number, the console tells them to guess higher. If the user guesses a number higher than the actual number, the console tells them to guess lower. If the user is unable to guess the number within the 5 attempts they lose the game.
